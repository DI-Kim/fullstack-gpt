I found information about the XZ backdoor. On 29 March 2024, software developer Andres Freund reported that a malicious backdoor was found in the Linux utility xz within the liblzma library in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 released in February 2024. The backdoor targeted Debian- and RPM-based systems running on the x86-64 architecture. It gives an attacker remote code execution capabilities on the affected Linux system. The issue has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.

XZ Utils is a set of free software command-line lossless data compressors that includes programs like lzma and xz for Unix-like operating systems and Microsoft Windows. The Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) is used for compression/decompression in XZ Utils.

A backdoor is a covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system. It can be used for securing remote access to a computer or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptosystems. Backdoors can take various forms, such as hidden parts of a program, separate programs, code in firmware, or parts of an operating system. Some backdoors are deliberately created for legitimate purposes, like providing manufacturers with a way to restore user passwords.
