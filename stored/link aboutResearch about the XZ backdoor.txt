####  NIGHTMARE SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK SCENARIO —

# What we know about the xz Utils backdoor that almost infected the world

## Malicious updates made to a ubiquitous tool were a few weeks away from
going mainstream.

On Friday, a lone Microsoft developer rocked the world when he revealed a
backdoor had been intentionally planted in xz Utils, an open source data
compression utility available on almost all installations of Linux and other
Unix-like operating systems. The person or people behind this project likely
spent years on it. They were likely very close to seeing the backdoor update
merged into Debian and Red Hat, the two biggest distributions of Linux, when
an eagle-eyed software developer spotted something fishy.

Backdoor found in widely used Linux utility targets encrypted SSH connections

"This might be the best executed supply chain attack we've seen described in
the open, and it's a nightmare scenario: malicious, competent, authorized
upstream in a widely used library," software and cryptography engineer Filippo
Valsorda said of the effort, which came frightfully close to succeeding.

Researchers have spent the weekend gathering clues. Here's what we know so
far.

**What is xz Utils?**

xz Utils is nearly ubiquitous in Linux. It provides lossless data compression
on virtually all Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. xz Utils
provides critical functions for compressing and decompressing data during all
kinds of operations. xz Utils also supports the legacy .lzma format, making
this component even more crucial.

**What happened?**

Andres Freund, a developer and engineer working on Microsoft’s PostgreSQL
offerings, was recently troubleshooting performance problems a Debian system
was experiencing with SSH, the most widely used protocol for remotely logging
in to devices over the Internet. Specifically, SSH logins were consuming too
many CPU cycles and were generating errors with valgrind, a utility for
monitoring computer memory.

Through sheer luck and Freund’s careful eye, he eventually discovered the
problems were the result of updates that had been made to xz Utils. On Friday,
Freund took to the Open Source Security List to disclose the updates were the
result of someone intentionally planting a backdoor in the compression
software.

It's hard to overstate the complexity of the social engineering and the inner
workings of the backdoor. Thomas Roccia, a researcher at Microsoft, published
a graphic on Mastodon that helps visualize the sprawling extent of the nearly
successful endeavor to spread a backdoor with a reach that would have dwarfed
the SolarWinds event from 2020.

**What does the backdoor do?**

Malicious code added to xz Utils versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 modified the way the
software functions. The backdoor manipulated sshd, the executable file used to
make remote SSH connections. Anyone in possession of a predetermined
encryption key could stash any code of their choice in an SSH login
certificate, upload it, and execute it on the backdoored device. No one has
actually seen code uploaded, so it's not known what code the attacker planned
to run. In theory, the code could allow for just about anything, including
stealing encryption keys or installing malware.

**Wait, how can a compression utility manipulate a process as security
sensitive as SSH?**

Any library can tamper with the inner workings of any executable it is linked
against. Often, the developer of the executable will establish a link to a
library that's needed for it to work properly. OpenSSH, the most popular sshd
implementation, doesn’t link the liblzma library, but Debian and many other
Linux distributions add a patch to link sshd to systemd, a program that loads
a variety of services during the system bootup. Systemd, in turn, links to
liblzma, and this allows xz Utils to exert control over sshd.

**How did this backdoor come to be?**

It would appear that this backdoor was years in the making. In 2021, someone
with the username JiaT75 made their first known commit to an open source
project. In retrospect, the change to the libarchive project is suspicious,
because it replaced the safe_fprint funcion with a variant that has long been
recognized as less secure. No one noticed at the time.

The following year, JiaT75 submitted a patch over the xz Utils mailing list,
and, almost immediately, a never-before-seen participant named Jigar Kumar
joined the discussion and argued that Lasse Collin, the longtime maintainer of
xz Utils, hadn’t been updating the software often or fast enough. Kumar, with
the support of Dennis Ens and several other people who had never had a
presence on the list, pressured Collin to bring on an additional developer to
maintain the project.

In January 2023, JiaT75 made their first commit to xz Utils. In the months
following, JiaT75, who used the name Jia Tan, became increasingly involved in
xz Utils affairs. For instance, Tan replaced Collins' contact information with
their own on oss-fuzz, a project that scans open source software for
vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Tan also requested that oss-fuzz
disable the ifunc function during testing, a change that prevented it from
detecting the malicious changes Tan would soon make to xz Utils.

In February of this year, Tan issued commits for versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of
xz Utils. The updates implemented the backdoor. In the following weeks, Tan or
others appealed to developers of Ubuntu, Red Hat, and Debian to merge the
updates into their OSes. Eventually, one of the two updates made its way into
the following releases, according to security firm Tenable:

The whole world got lucky that one developer was determined enough to discover
the cause of a minor performance regression. Just makes you wonder what else
hasn't yet been discovered in our open source tooling out there.  
  
Really eye opening, thank you Andres!  
  
Edit: And of course, Dan for the wonderful article.

This conclusion ignores the huge value that the patches that all OS apply to
packages provides. Without patches much upstream software will not build, will
not run correctly.

While this is true, to a degree, it's also quite possible that if there were a
lot of interesting targets out there that didn't patch sshd to use systemd and
libxz, that given the level of access they had, the actor here could almost
certainly found some other way to put an obfuscated backdoor into the code.  
  
I mean, certainly the OpenSSH project is obviously in the clear, but having
gained commit access to a critical library, I don't think we could feel safe
that "Jia Tan" couldn't have constructed a different backdoor even if they
couldn't use the particular behavior Debian and Ubuntu added to their version
of SSH.  
  
And I'm not sure anybody feels totally safe until somebody audits the code to
make sure there's nothing else lurking in here that might be dangerous.

The prime reason is a very well funded and capable attacker looked for a way
in.  
if not xz or systemd then they would have attacked via the next candidate weak
point.

I do know that the OpenSSH devs are very strict on not increasing attack
surface. The main reason why they did not want to link to systemd in the
distributed version. You can be sure that OpenSSH as distributed contains less
opportunity for attackers than the modified versions. That's my main point:
modifications by distributions are not always improvements.

**MikeGale**

We are lucky that this was detected and that some competent people have moved
in to analyse. I presume more analysis is still being done. (Thanks to them.)  
  
What we don't know is how many **other** similar attacks have been deployed,
and how many are **in preparation**.  
  
**What can decent people do** to reduce our risks?  
  
Thoughts that come to mind:  
1\. Some of those who do this, often thankless, maintenance work might like
**more support**. This might be financial contributions, or people (who know
what they're doing) reviewing code submissions. Those who incorporate these
libraries into their own programs (and all users) should maybe think about
this. If there were a "donate to the maintainers" button on a story like this,
that would convert the immediate story into something of greater value, if the
maintainer would like that.  
2\. Some of the maintainers might appreciate **recognition**. Some won't, but
worth considering.  
3\. Some who **use the libraries** can improve the checking they do.  
4\. Unpleasant people who **harass maintainers** should be detected and
treated appropriately.

Right? I didn’t realise until I read this article just how far back this
started. Now you’ve got to wonder: if this was a group, how many other so-far
benign identities they have, contributing good code and building up
reputations. And how easy it would be for them to slip a little something into
another fundamental tool.

# The Mystery of ‘Jia Tan,’ the XZ Backdoor Mastermind

The thwarted XZ Utils supply chain attack was years in the making. Now, clues
suggest nation-state hackers were behind the persona that inserted the
malicious code.

The scourge of software supply chain attacks—an increasingly common hacking
technique that hides malicious code in a widely used legitimate program—can
take many forms. Hackers can penetrate an update server to seed out their
malware, or even break into the network where the software was developed to
corrupt it at the source. Or, in the case of one particularly insidious
software supply chain attacker known as Jia Tan, they can spend two years
politely and enthusiastically volunteering to help.

The XZ Backdoor: Everything You Need to Know

By Dan Goodin, Ars Technica

Over the weekend, the cybersecurity and open source software community was
shocked by the news that a relatively new, experimental version of XZ Utils—a
compression utility integrated into many popular distributions of
Linux—contained a backdoor that would have allowed hackers in possession of a
specific private key to connect to the backdoored system and run their own
commands as an administrator. Only some chance detective work carried out by a
lone Microsoft engineer, Andres Freund—who’d detected a strange delay in how
the remote connection protocol SSH was running in a version of the Linux
variant Debian—caught the spy trick before it ended up in many millions of
systems worldwide.

That XZ Utils backdoor, it’s now clear, was inserted by none other than the
lead open source steward of XZ Utils, a developer who went by the name Jia
Tan. In the wake of the backdoor's discovery, a mystery percolating through
the tech world remains: Who is Jia Tan, and who did he, or she—or very likely
_they_ —truly work for?

Jia Tan exploited open source software’s crowdsourced approach to coding
whereby anyone can suggest changes to a program on code repositories like
GitHub, where the changes are reviewed by other coders before they’re
integrated into the software. Peeling back Jia Tan’s documented history in the
open source programming world reveals that they first appeared in November
2021 with the GitHub username JiaT75, then made contributions to other open
source projects using the name Jia Tan, or sometimes Jia Cheong Tan, for more
than a year before beginning to submit changes to XZ Utils.

By January 2023, Jia Tan’s code was being integrated into XZ Utils. Over the
next year, they would largely take control of the project from its original
maintainer, Lasse Collin, a change driven in part by nagging emails sent to
Collin by a handful users complaining about slow updates. (Whether those users
were unwitting accomplices, or actually working with Jia Tan to persuade
Collin to relinquish control, remains unclear. None of the users replied to
requests for comment from WIRED.) Finally, Jia Tan added their stealthy
backdoor to a version of XZ Utils in February of this year.

That inhumanly patient approach, along with the technical features and
sophistication of the backdoor itself, has led many in the cybersecurity world
to believe that Jia Tan must, in fact, be a handle operated by state-sponsored
hackers—and very good ones. “This multiyear operation was very cunning, and
the implanted backdoor is incredibly deceptive,” says Costin Raiu, who until
last year served as the most senior researcher and head of the global research
and analysis team at Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky. “I’d say this is a
nation-state-backed group, one with long-term goals in mind that affords to
invest into multiyear infiltration of open source projects.”

As for which nation, Raiu names the usual suspects: China, Russia, and North
Korea. He says it’s still too early to know the true culprit. “One thing is
for sure clear,” he adds. “This was more cunning than all previous software
supply chain attacks I’ve seen.”

## A Very Private, Very Busy Programmer

As scrutiny around Jia Tan has mounted since the revelation of the XZ Utils
backdoor last Friday, researchers have noted that the persona has remarkably
good operational security. Independent security reporter Brian Krebs writes
that he could find “zero trace” of Jia Tan’s email address outside of the
messages they sent to fellow open source contributors, even after scouring
breached databases. Jia Tan also appears to have routed all their
communications through a VPN with a Singaporean IP address.

The lack of any other online presence linked to Jia Tan points toward the
account being a “single-purpose invented persona” and indicates how much
sophistication, patience, and thought was put into developing the backdoor,
says Will Thomas, an instructor at the SANS Institute, a cybersecurity
training firm. The Jia Tan persona has vanished since the backdoor was
discovered, and emails sent by WIRED to a Gmail address linked to it have gone
unanswered. Jia Tan’s GitHub account has been suspended, a company
spokesperson tells WIRED.

In fact, the only real footprints Jia Tan appears to have left behind were
their contributions to the open source development community, where they were
a prolific contributor: Disturbingly, Jia Tan’s first code change was to the
“libarchive” compression library, another very widely used open source
component. That first change swapped one function with a less secure
alternative, potentially attempting another malicious code change, notes
developer Evan Boehs in his detailed Jia Tan timeline—though the problem has
since been fixed.

In total, Jia Tan made 6,000 code changes to at least seven projects between
2021 and February 2024, according to Michael Scott, the cofounder of the
cybersecurity firm NetRise who previously worked in the Marine Corps
cyberwarfare group under US Cyber Command. Determining all the branching
effects of those changes is nearly impossible, Scott says. Because those
changes, known as “commits,” are often batched into collections in a process
known as “squashing commits,” it’s not always apparent which exact changes
were made by Jia Tan. And the difficulty of tracing which of the many versions
of a library like libarchive ended up in which software adds yet another layer
of obfuscation. “It’s going to be a bit of a mess pulling on this thread and
trying to figure out where all these things ended up,” Scott says.

Scott notes that, throughout this time, Jia Tan was also emailing with other
contributors, writing in a “very concise, very dry,” but not unfriendly tone
that Scott compares to the output of ChatGPT. “Nice job to both of you for
getting this feature as far as it is already,” Jia Tan wrote at one point. Or,
at another: “Let me know your thoughts on these patches when you have a chance
:)” Jordi Mas, a developer who contributed to XZ Utils and had emailed
“feedback” from Jia Tan, says in retrospect that the account went to extra
levels to build trust in the persona.

Ultimately, Scott argues that those three years of code changes and polite
emails were likely not spent sabotaging multiple software projects, but rather
building up a history of credibility in preparation for the sabotage of XZ
Utils specifically—and potentially other projects in the future. “He just
never got to that step because we got lucky and found his stuff,” says Scott.
“So that’s burned now, and he’s gonna have to go back to square one.”

## Technical Ticks and Time Zones

Despite Jia Tan’s persona as a single individual, their yearslong preparation
is a hallmark of a well-organized state-sponsored hacker group, argues Raiu,
the former Kaspersky lead researcher. So too are the technical hallmarks of
the XZ Utils malicious code that Jia Tan added. Raiu notes that, at a glance,
the code truly looks like a compression tool. “It’s written in a very
subversive manner,” he says. It’s also a “passive” backdoor, Raiu says, so it
wouldn’t reach out to a command-and-control server that might help identify
the backdoor’s operator. Instead, it waits for the operator to connect to the
target machine via SSH and authenticate with a private key—one generated with
a particularly strong cryptographic function known as ED448.

The backdoor’s careful design could be the work of US hackers, Raiu notes, but
he suggests that’s unlikely, since the US wouldn’t typically sabotage open
source projects—and if it did, the National Security Agency would probably use
a quantum-resistant cryptographic function, which ED448 is not. That leaves
non-US groups with a history of supply chain attacks, Raiu suggests, like
China’s APT41, North Korea’s Lazarus Group, and Russia’s APT29.

At a glance, Jia Tan certainly looks East Asian—or is meant to. The time zone
of Jia Tan’s commits are UTC+8: That’s China’s time zone, and only an hour off
from North Korea’s. However, an analysis by two researchers, Rhea Karty and
Simon Henniger, suggests that Jia Tan may have simply changed the time zone of
their computer to UTC+8 before every commit. In fact, several commits were
made with a computer set to an Eastern European or Middle Eastern time zone
instead, perhaps when Jia Tan forgot to make the change.

“Another indication that they are not from China is the fact that they worked
on notable Chinese holidays,” say Karty and Henniger, students at Dartmouth
College and the Technical University of Munich, respectively. They note that
Jia Tan also didn't submit new code on Christmas or New Year's. Boehs, the
developer, adds that much of the work starts at 9 am and ends at 5 pm for
Eastern European or Middle Eastern time zones. “The time range of commits
suggests this was not some project that they did outside of work,” Boehs says.

Though that leaves countries like Iran and Israel as possibilities, the
majority of clues lead back to Russia, and specifically Russia’s APT29 hacking
group, argues Dave Aitel, a former NSA hacker and founder of the cybersecurity
firm Immunity. Aitel points out that APT29—widely believed to work for
Russia’s foreign intelligence agency, known as the SVR—has a reputation for
technical care of a kind that few other hacker groups show. APT29 also carried
out the Solar Winds compromise, perhaps the most deftly coordinated and
effective software supply chain attack in history. That operation matches the
style of the XZ Utils backdoor far more than the cruder supply chain attacks
of APT41 or Lazarus, by comparison.

“It could very well be someone else,” says Aitel. “But I mean, if you’re
looking for the most sophisticated supply chain attacks on the planet, that’s
going to be our dear friends at the SVR.”

Security researchers agree, at least, that it’s unlikely that Jia Tan is a
real person, or even one person working alone. Instead, it seems clear that
the persona was the online embodiment of a new tactic from a new, well-
organized organization—a tactic that nearly worked. That means we should
expect to see Jia Tan return by other names: seemingly polite and enthusiastic
contributors to open source projects, hiding a government’s secret intentions
in their code commits.

 _Updated 4/3/2024 at 12:30 pm ET to note the possibility of Israeli or
Iranian involvement._
